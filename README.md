# Bacterium-Reproduction-Rate-Analysis
This MATLAB project analyzes the reproduction rate of a bacterium in different culture media over a 48-hour period. 

The bacterium reproduces every 120 minutes in Medium P and every 180 minutes in Medium Q. The project calculates and plots the number of bacteria in each medium from the beginning of the experiment until the end of 48 hours.
